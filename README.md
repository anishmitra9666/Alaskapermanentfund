# Alaska-UBI-analysis
# Looks at how the Alaska Permanent Fund(a form of a universal basic income in Alaska) impacted violent and property crime rates in the first two years before and after its start year of 1982. 
# This was to test the hypothesis that due to the increase in income and decrease in income inequality, violent and property crime would both reduce. 
# It was also expected property crime would be affected a lot more that the correlation between the explanatory variables would have a much stronger correlation with property crime than violent crime.
# The raw data was created on IPUMS CPS and is stored in the Copy of s165u1u4BUbp (1).csv file and Copy of s133UN01qyLD (2) file.
# The Copy of s165u1u4BUbp (1).csv file carries income data while the Copy of s133UN01qyLD (2) file carries the race data.
# The data cleaning was done twice (once in Python and once in SQL). The reason for this was that I had not learnt SQL when I first did it. 
# The file for the Python data cleaning had most of the initial iterations but the final code was in cleaningandedacode.ipynb.
# Both SQL and Python produced finalcleandata.xlsx after the data was cleaned.
# Exploratory data analysis was also performed on Python.
# crime data.xlsx was also added to the finalcleandata.xlsx table.
